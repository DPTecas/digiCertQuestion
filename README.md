In order to use this program, one must go to https://censys.io/register and register
a free account with censys. This will allow the programmer to use the API by giving
them an api id and a secret which need to be put in place of the areas in the code
that say "UNIQUE TO PROGRAMMER USING THE API." This will allow the user to query the
API for subdomains.
